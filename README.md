# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets on COVID-19 Vaccination: Using AWS Comprehended in R

With the arrival of different types of vaccines for the COVID-19 in the past months, the fight against the virus has gained significance. Although there are further developments and investigations in the case of vaccination, some people still have a skeptical and negative attitude. In this study, I employ sentiment analysis by collecting tweets and hashtags from Twitter that have been related to the COVID vaccination. The primary reason for this project is to detect individuals’ attitudes on vaccination. I will be using Amazon Comprehend in R to analyze a set of tweets whereas I also aim to characterize people's feelings about COVID-19 Vaccination.

### Access key from AWS
An AWS account is required to access Amazon Comprehend. Having an account for secure communication with the API is the first step, which is the access that is also a key that must be generated in Amazon’s Identity and Access Management (IAM) Console.
